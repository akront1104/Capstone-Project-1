Firefighter Casualties in U.S (2000 - 2015)

For over 20 years, the United States Fire Administration (USFA) has tracked the number of on-duty firefighter fatalities and conducted an annual analysis. The objective of my report is to identify all on-duty firefighter fatalities that occurred in the U.S. and to analyze the circumstances surrounding each occurrence. My analysis is intended to help identify approaches that could reduce the number of firefighter deaths in the future.
